	<p class="regulartext">Ads. Ugh. I know. But hosting a website isn't free, so we use Google Ads to try and offset that cost. Why Google Ads? They're screened by Google to make sure there's no malicious code or anything like that, that way your password stays secure. Ads suck, but they don't have to <i>completely</i> suck.</p>
